Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm

Theory:
The Cohen-Sutherland algorithm is used to clip lines to a rectangular window. 
It determines if a line is completely inside, outside, or partially inside the window and clips it accordingly. 
The line is classified using outcodes, which are 4-bit codes indicating the position of each endpoint relative to the window.

Algorithm Steps:
1. Compute Outcodes: Calculate outcodes for both endpoints based on their position relative to the clipping window.
2. Check Accept/Reject:
   - If both outcodes are 0, the line is fully inside the window (accept).
   - If the bitwise AND of both outcodes is non-zero, the line is fully outside (reject).
3. Clip Line: If one endpoint is outside, calculate the intersection of the line with the window boundary and update the endpoint.
4. Repeat: Continue until the line is either fully inside or fully outside the window.

Outcode Calculation:
- Top: If y > ymax, set the top bit.
- Bottom: If y < ymin, set the bottom bit.
- Right: If x > xmax, set the right bit.
- Left: If x < xmin, set the left bit.

Formula for Clipping:
1. Vertical Clipping (left/right boundaries):
   y = y1 + ((y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)) * (boundary - x1)
2. Horizontal Clipping (top/bottom boundaries):
   x = x1 + ((x2 - x1) / (y2 - y1)) * (boundary - y1)
